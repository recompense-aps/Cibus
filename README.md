# Cibus

I really hate finding recipes on the internet. Everytime I load a recipe website
I have to navigate through ad after ad and close pop ups and scroll through
stories and videos. I just want to cook. No more bs, just recipes.

Cibus is a web app for stripping out the fluff of online recipes. It allows the
user to get and optionally save a recipe via url with the extra garbage stripped out.

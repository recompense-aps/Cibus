# Cibus

I really hate finding recipes on the internet. Everytime I load a recipe website
I have to navigate through ad after ad and close pop ups and scroll through
stories and videos. I just want to cook. No more bs, just recipes.

Cibus is a web app for stripping out the fluff of online recipes. It allows the
user to get and optionally save a recipe via url with the extra garbage stripped out.

## Roadmap
As of now, cibus is not meant to be a fully operationl app, but rather a proof of concept.

Recipe sites that intended for support: (the goal is 5)
- [ ] [All Recipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/)
- [ ] [Simply Recipes](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/)
- [ ] [Tasty](https://tasty.co/)
- [ ] [Taste of Home](https://www.tasteofhome.com/)
- [ ] [Food network](https://www.foodnetwork.com/)
- [ ] Some sort of generic parser as well (not intended to be fool proof)
- [ ] In-app searchability of these websites

The user might want to save recipes as well
- [ ] Functional user accounts

    "I used Wondra to dredge the chicken instead of a-p flour (it's finer and less clumpy), then followed all the ingredients but changed the proportions because I used a lot more chicken than this (when I cook I cook big). It's forgiving-but careful about too many capers and and barely salt the chicken because the capers make everything super salty. I added extra olive oil and butter to the saucepan and added ground garlic and a few flakes of red pepper to simmer awhile. Didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried. I served this over penne since I didn't have linquine or spaghetti. While the pasta drained, I added about 1/3 cup of olive oil to the pasta pot, a half a stick of butter, more garlic granules and about a cup of chicken broth--heated to boiling and tossed the cooked pasta back into it. Put in serving dish, then placed the chicken and all the sauce from the pan over the pasta and topped the pasta and chicken with some grated parmesan cheese. I have never made a piccata I liked as much as this one and my husband and I inhaled it. YUM."

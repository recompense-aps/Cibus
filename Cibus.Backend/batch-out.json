      "Transfer the plantains to a mortar and pestle (also known as a pilón), and add the ground pork rinds, garlic, salt, and pepper. Mash together until fully incorporated, 5–8 minutes. If needed, remove the plantain mixture from the pilón and mix with your hands.",

      "Meanwhile, make the shrimp sauce. Heat the olive oil in a medium pan over medium-low heat. Add the onion, garlic, and red bell pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes, sofrito, adobo sauce, paprika, and coriander, and stir until combined and the mixture begins to deepen in color, 1 minute.",

      "Fill the mofongo cups with the warm shrimp and sauce. Garnish with cilantro, then serve.",
      "Enjoy!"

      "Very good after some tweaking. I guess we're not \"lemon people\", and the sauce was WAY too lemony when made following the recipe. We're trying to cut back on carbs so not serving with pasta or rice to \"cut\" it really brought the flavors to the forefront. I ended up adding about a cup of milk and a half a cup of light sour cream to cut the acid, and used a flour slurry when I discovered we were out of cornstarch. Wanted to add capers but found a whopping ten of them left in the bottom of the jar... sheesh. I also did not cook the chicken with the sauce since I wanted the coating to remain as crispy as possible. I just spooned the sauce over the chicken once plated, and then sprinkled chopped black olives over everything. Used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts, and used more onion since I didn't have as many mushrooms as called for. Also added two cloves of chopped fresh garlic. You most definitely want to double the sauce. Very, very tasty! Hubby loved it, too."

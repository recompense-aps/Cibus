I used a large electric skillet to have enough space for 6 pieces of chicken, then added about 50% more sauce. The lemon flavor stands out, so I have only used freshly squeezed lemon juice. I did substitute Italian seasoning for the fresh parsley. If some of your guests don't like lemons and capers, just don't return those pieces to the sauce mixture, and end up with lightly battered fried chicken. With picky eaters, I have also made the sauce separately and let each person pour it on like gravy, if they wanted to try it. I prefer to return the chicken to the sauce to soak in more flavor like the recipe says, but it is still quite good if the sauce is added later."

I had a hungry clan so I doubled everything and kept the first batch of chicken warm in the oven while cooking the 2nd batch.

I added a small amount (1-2 tsp) of a cornstarch/water blend to thicken the sauce a little bit since I cut back a tad on the butter. Definitely a winner and I've been requested to make this again.

        "contents": "Delicious! I would not call it \"quick\", but it is certainly worth the effort. I have made it several times, and everyone raves about this dish. Chicken breasts in my area are sometimes so thick that I either cook them longer or butterfly them to make them thinner. Either way, the lemon, butter, wine, and caper sauce is the key to the flavors. If you use more chicken than is in the recipe, don't forget to make extra sauce to go with it. I used a large electric skillet to have enough space for 6 pieces of chicken, then added about 50% more sauce. The lemon flavor stands out, so I have only used freshly squeezed lemon juice. I did substitute Italian seasoning for the fresh parsley. If some of your guests don't like lemons and capers, just don't return those pieces to the sauce mixture, and end up with lightly battered fried chicken. With picky eaters, I have also made the sauce separately and let each person pour it on like gravy, if they wanted to try it. I prefer to return the chicken to the sauce to soak in more flavor like the recipe says, but it is still quite good if the sauce is added later."
